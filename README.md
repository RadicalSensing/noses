# Radical Sensing

# Radical Sensing is a body of work at the intersection of wearable technology, brain computer interfaces (BCI) and the sense of smell. Radical Sensing explores the potential of designing for a radical augmentation of smell in the form of a radical nose prosthetic.

# Radical Sensing was created during a Wearable Technology course at Art Center College of Design's Graduate Media Design Practice program in Spring 2015 (Selwa Sweidan) and Summer 2015 (Selwa Sweidan + Jay Hong), taught by Prof. Phil van Allen.

# The prototypes were used to speculate and iterate on BCI olfactory prosthetics: http://67.media.tumblr.com/41e64742caa0c8749580a4658a925e24/tumblr_o58m99yQM91vqirdbo2_1280.png
